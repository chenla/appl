** 9. Fashion
Fashion patterns are ephemeral, throwing spaghetti at the
wall that lower levels are watching to see what sticks.

So I imagine that many of the Fashion patterns will be about
how to give fashion the freedom to explore without fucking
up lower layers.  This has always been an important function
of any society, which comes in the form of setting limits on
what you can mess with, where you can mess with it and
defining the thresholds to ensure things don't get out of
hand.  This is a delicate balance because it's important to
pay attention to fashion and learn from it.

Fashion is all about risk taking, and risks are, well,
risky.  There is a high rate of failure.

Fashion and popularity are bedfellows and popularity is a
crude blunt instrument, but it has its uses so long as the
popular comes at the expense of more important things,
especially morals and ethics.  Popularity is always
threatening to sweep away things that matter, populism, or
pandering to what is popular is very dangerous because it
preys on our cognitive shortcomings and plays to parts of
our brain that reacts rather than considers.

Fashion is where memes are born

** 8. Commerce & Industry

Commerce is interaction, Industry is production.


 - supply & demand
 - production
 - markets
 - logistics
** 7. Infrastructure
 - * | commons
   - forest, pasture, paths, ponds
   - roads, tunnels, bridges
   - knowledge & data
 - * | borders, possession & ownership
   - property
   - airspace
   - bandwidth
 - * | network of local grids 
   - water
   - electric
   - info: compute, cognition, storage
   - fuels -- petro, bio, gas -- solid/liquid/gas 
   - sewage collction and processing
   - trash collecting and processing
 - stockpiles -- banks, food stores, metals, commodities
   should be understood in terms of D. Meadows "size of
   buffers"cite:meadows:1999leverage

 - generation -- electic, cooling, storage, atmosphere
 - gas/electric charging stations
 - logistics
 - transactions: currency & exchange
 - buildings
** 6. Governance
 - representation
 - judgement 
 - force
 - territory
   - porous borders (right to travel and emigrate) based on carrying capacity
 - corporate ???
 - Fabric of Guilds (overlap, checks and balances)
 - * | Hierarchies of Mastery
   - Masters
   - Journeymen
   - Apprentices
** 5. Culture
 - everything has a story
   - myths, legends, anecdotes, gossip
   - sacred or canonical stories - forms a cultural encyclopedia
 - generational change
   - people can only change so much in a lifetime.
   - after a certain age, can change little -- ranganathan's
     book story 
   - need to teach people when very young
   - but children are also being taught by parents too old
     to change.
   - there is always room to push upper and lower limits of
     cultural norms
   - so change can not be faster than cultural norms will
     permit in a given generation.
   - change too fast, and people become unmoored from
     culture, identity and are alienated from society and
     each other.
   - zero day change never works
 - culture is largely derived from economic level of development
 - empirical pragmatism over subjective belief
 - * | Language
 - * | Family
 - * | Cultural Rituals

 - Cognitive Toolbox
 - * | Rights (as in human rights)
   - life --> soverign existence, base thresholds for living and dieing
   - liberty (of movement, self determination)
   - speech
   - privacy
   - base air, sleep & rest , food, medical care, shelter transporation & material goods
       deprivation of these things can never be used as incentive 
   - education
   - access to information & communication
 - * | Obligations
   - The Golden Rule
   - Enlightened Self Interest
   - Informed Participation
   - Transparency
   - Contribution (time, mind, material wealth???)

 - COSMOLOGICAL
   - it from bit           --> binary nature of quantum events
                           -   information is physical
                           --> information is base unit

   - entropy's arrow       --> everything breaks down
                           -   living systems build order
                           -   entropy wins in the end
                           -   entropy gives time a direction
                           -   time creates stories
                           --> arrow of time

   - causal propagation    --> everything is process
                           -   absolute  -> light cones
                           -   practical -> time to do things
                           --> pace layers

   - the cosmic holarchy   --> everything is nested part/whole
                           --> everything forms a directed graph

 - SYSTEMS
   - living systems        --> the opposite is dead heaps
                           --> complexity results in uncertainty
