** 9. Fashion
Fashion patterns are ephemeral, throwing spaghetti at the
wall that lower levels are watching to see what sticks.

So I imagine that many of the Fashion patterns will be about
how to give fashion the freedom to explore without fucking
up lower layers.  This has always been an important function
of any society, which comes in the form of setting limits on
what you can mess with, where you can mess with it and
defining the thresholds to ensure things don't get out of
hand.  This is a delicate balance because it's important to
pay attention to fashion and learn from it.

Fashion is all about risk taking, and risks are, well,
risky.  There is a high rate of failure.

Fashion and popularity are bedfellows and popularity is a
crude blunt instrument, but it has its uses so long as the
popular comes at the expense of more important things,
especially morals and ethics.  Popularity always is at the
cusp of sweeping away things that matter, populism, or
pandering to what is popular is very dangerous because it
preys on our cognitive shortcomings and plays to parts of
our brain that reacts rather than considers.

Fashion is where memes are born

** 8. Commerce & Industry

Commerce is interaction, Industry is production.


 - supply & demand
 - production
 - markets
 - logistics
** 7. Infrastructure
 - * | commons
   - forest, pasture, paths, ponds
   - roads, tunnels, bridges
   - knowledge & data
 - * | borders, possession & ownership
   - property
   - airspace
   - bandwidth
 - * | network of local grids 
   - water
   - electric
   - info: compute, cognition, storage
   - fuels -- petro, bio, gas -- solid/liquid/gas 
   - sewage collction and processing
   - trash collecting and processing
 - stockpiles -- banks, food stores, metals, commodities
   should be understood in terms of D. Meadows "size of
   buffers"cite:meadows:1999leverage

 - generation -- electic, cooling, storage, atmosphere
 - gas/electric charging stations
 - logistics
 - transactions: currency & exchange
 - buildings
