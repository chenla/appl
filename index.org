Commerce is interaction, Industry is production.

   - sewage collction and processing
   - trash collecting and processing
 - Stockpiles -- banks, food stores, metals, commodities
   should be understood in terms of D. Meadows "size of
   buffers" cite:meadows:1999leverage

** 5. Culture
 - Shared Stories
   - everything has a story
   - Art
   - Calendars
     - Microseasons (climate, food, tasks)
   - Mythos:  myths, legends, anecdotes, gossip
   - Sacred or canonical stories - forms a cultural
     encyclopedia
   - Personified Ideas: gods, graces, angels, muses
   - Origin stories
 - Generational Change
   - people can only change so much in a lifetime.
   - after a certain age, can change little -- ranganathan's
     book story 
   - need to teach people when very young
   - but children are also being taught by parents too old
     to change.
   - there is always room to push upper and lower limits of
     cultural norms
   - so change can not be faster than cultural norms will
     permit in a given generation.
   - change too fast, and people become unmoored from
     culture, identity and are alienated from society and
     each other.
   - antipattern: zero day change
 - culture is largely derived from economic level of development
 - empirical pragmatism:  over subjective belief
